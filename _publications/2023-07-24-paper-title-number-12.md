    <div>Memristive Reservoir Computing (MRC) is a promising computing architecture for time series tasks, but lacks explainability, leading to unreliable predictions. To address this issue, we propose an evolutionary
framework to explain the time series predictions of MRC systems. Our proposed approach attributes the feature importance of the time series via an evolutionary approach to explain the predictions. Our experiments show that our approach successfully identified the most influential factors, demonstrating the effectiveness of our design and its superiority in terms of explanation compared to state-of-the-art methods.</div>
