    <div style="color: rosybrown; text-align: justify;">Memristor-based neural network circuits offer promising hardware implementations for artificial neural networks. However, the training speed is hindered by asynchronous synaptic weight adjustments, and the relationship between synaptic weight variation and control signal duration remains unclear. This paper introduces a neuron circuit with memristor-CMOS hybrid synaptic circuits, where memristance can be adjusted using positive voltage. We implement an inference mechanism to establish the relationship between synaptic weight changes and control signal duration. Based on this neuron circuit, we propose a single-layer neural network (SNN) for character recognition and a multi-layer neural network (MNN) for pattern classification. With microcontroller control, both networks achieve synchronous weight adjustment, allowing simultaneous memristance changes in all required synaptic circuits in one iteration.</div>
