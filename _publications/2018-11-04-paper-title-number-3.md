    <div>Memristor-based neural network circuits are considered as promising hardware implementations for ar- tificial neural networks. In the training of memristor-based neural networks, it slows down the trainingspeed that synaptic weights cannot be adjusted synchronously. Meanwhile, the relation between synapticweight variation and the duration of control signals is unknown in neuron circuits, which is disadvanta- geous for the training. This paper proposes a neuron circuit connecting memristor-CMOS hybrid synapticcircuits whose memristance can be adjusted simply by the positive voltage. According to the structure ofthe neuron circuit, an inference is implemented to obtain the relation between the increment or decre- ment of synaptic weight and the lasting time of control signal. Then, based on the presented neuroncircuit, this paper proposes a single layer neural network (SNN) achieving character recognition and amulti-layer neural network (MNN) for pattern classification. Under the control of a microcontroller, thetwo networks realize synchronous weight adjustment that all the synaptic circuits required to change canadjust memristance at the same time in an iteration.</div>
