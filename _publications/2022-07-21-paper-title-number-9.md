  <span style="color: rosybrown; text-align: justify;">In circuit design automation using evolutionary algorithms, circuit representation is crucial. Existing studies on circuit representations face issues such as limited design diversity and inefficient SPICE netlist conversion. This paper introduces a novel tree-based representation for analog circuits, featuring an intuitive mapping rule for SPICE netlists and an effective crossover operator. We propose a genetic programming framework that evolves both circuit topology and device values. The approach is validated with three benchmark circuits, demonstrating improved fitness, component count, and efficiency over existing methods. Additionally, we explore a memristor-based pulse generation circuit, showcasing its compactness and energy efficiency compared to manually-designed counterparts.</span>
