    <div>The nonvolatility and resistance variability of memristor make it a candidate for emulating complex dynamic behaviors in the neural system. In this paper, thememristive neuron with
homeostatic plasticity is implemented. The memristor is applied to the neuron circuit, and its memristance represents the membrane sensibility of neurons.Composed of a triggermodule, a pulse generation module and a feedback module, the memristor-based neuron can adaptively adjust the firing rate of neuron and maintain it in the inherent firing rate range, which shows similarities to its biological counterpart. The proposed design can mimic firing rate behaviors of the electrophysiological experiment performed in rodent, where the homeostatic plasticity of neuron is inhibited by sleep signal and promoted by wake signal. Furthermore, all the simulations are conducted in Cadence PSPICE, and the functionality of the design is proved with the simulation.</div>
