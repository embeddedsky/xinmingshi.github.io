    <div>Adaptive firing rate of neuron plays an indispensable role in stabilizing the neural system, which means that the firing rate of neuron could be adjusted adaptively within an inherent range. In this paper, two aspects of implementing the adaptive firing rate are proposed at the circuit level. First, a memristor model is used in the neuron circuit to represent membrane sensitivity. Second, the threshold voltage of neuron
circuit can be adjusted adaptively to change the firing rate. Combined these two methods, the adaptive firing rate of neuron circuit is realized effectively, which is in accordance with its biological counterpart. Furthermore, the proposed neuron circuit is applied in the spiking neural network to verify its functionality, where pattern recognition could be realized. All the simulations are carried out on PSPICE.</div>
