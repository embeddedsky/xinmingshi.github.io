      Zilu Wang, <b>Xinming Shi</b>, and Xin Yao<br>
     This work introduces a hardware architecture for evolutionary algorithms using memristive arrays, enabling sparse and approximate computing through parallel analog computation. Our implementation demonstrates a significant speed improvement of at least four orders of magnitude. Additionally, we investigate fault tolerance and parameter adaptability through grounded simulations. The results show that the system can evolve and adapt to failures or changes in the memristive arrays, highlighting the architecture's robustness and adaptability.

     <b>Xinming Shi</b>, Leandro L. Minku,and Xin Yao<br>
     Memristive reservoirs have gained significant attention in various research fields. However, their deterministic hardware implementation poses challenges for hardware reservoir adaptation. In this work, we introduce an evolvable memristive reservoir circuit based on reconfigurable memristive units (RMUs) that can adaptively evolve for different tasks, directly evolving the configuration signals of memristors to avoid device variance. We also propose a scalable algorithm for evolving this reconfigurable memristive reservoir circuit, ensuring circuit validity according to circuit laws and sparse topology for scalability and feasibility during evolution.

     <b>Xinming Shi</b>, Leandro L. Minku,and Xin Yao<br>
The Time Delay Reservoir (TDR) is a hardware-friendly machine learning approach that reduces connection overhead in neural networks. However, it struggles with long-term dependency tasks. We introduce a higher-order delay unit to enhance reservoir memory, using PSO for adaptivity. We also propose a memristive implementation of TDR, using dynamic memristors and memristor-based delay elements, which is feasible, effective, and more efficient in terms of circuit area and power consumption compared to traditional hardware reservoirs.

     <b>Xinming Shi</b>, Leandro L. Minku,and Xin Yao<br>
In circuit design automation using evolutionary algorithms, circuit representation is crucial. Existing studies on circuit representations face issues such as limited design diversity and inefficient SPICE netlist conversion. This paper introduces a novel tree-based representation for analog circuits, featuring an intuitive mapping rule for SPICE netlists and an effective crossover operator. We propose a genetic programming framework that evolves both circuit topology and device values. The approach is validated with three benchmark circuits and a memristor-based pulse generation circuit, showcasing its compactness and energy efficiency compared to manually-designed counterparts.

     <b>Xinming Shi</b>, Zhigang Zeng, Le Yang and Yi Huang<br>
In this paper, a memristive neuron with homeostatic plasticity is implemented. The memristor is integrated into the neuron circuit, where its memristance represents the membrane sensitivity of neurons. The memristor-based neuron comprises a trigger module, a pulse generation module, and a feedback module. This configuration allows the neuron to adaptively adjust its firing rate and maintain it within the inherent range, mirroring its biological counterpart. The proposed design can replicate the firing rate behaviors observed in electrophysiological experiments on rodents, where the homeostatic plasticity of neurons is inhibited by sleep signals and promoted by wake signals. Furthermore, all simulations are conducted in Cadence PSPICE, validating the functionality of the design.
